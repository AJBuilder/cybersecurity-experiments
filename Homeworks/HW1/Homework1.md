- Do NOT change the template except the answer portion. 


- Use Markdown to complete the answers.

- You can use your favorite Markdown editor.
  
- In your answers, if code is included, all code should be placed in code blocks/fences. For
  example:

  ```python
  def somefunc(param1='', param2=0):
      '''A docstring'''
      if param1 > param2: # interesting
          print 'Greater'
      return (param2 - param1 + 1) or None
  ```

## Problem Set

### Problem 1

Please use your own words to describe **VigenÃ¨re cipher**, and how to break it.
#### Answer

A VigenÃ¨re cipher is when a key is used to shift the characters of a plaintext differently character by character.

If the key is shorter than the plaintext, the key is the applied repeatedly to the the rest of the plaintext.

### Problem 2

The following word is encrypted using **Caesar cipher**. Please figure out the offset used in this encryption and what the original word is.

`xqluvkd`

#### Answer

The offset of the Ceasar cipher is 10.
The orignial word is `havefun`.

  ```python
# Shift a lowercase letter by the specified 'shift'
def shiftLetter(character, shift): 
    character = chr(ord(character) + shift) # Add shift
    if ord(character) > ord('z'): # If exceeded the alphabet
        # Add the remainder to the start of the alphabet
        character = chr(ord('a') + (ord(character) % (ord('z') + 1)))
    return character

if __name__ =='__main__':
    
    message = 'xqluvkd'
    
    for shifting in range(0, 23): # Test every shift 0-22
        newMess = ''
        for character in range(0, len(message)): # Shift every character
            newMess += shiftLetter(message[character], shifting)
        print("Shift: " + str(shifting) + " -> " + str(newMess))
  ```
