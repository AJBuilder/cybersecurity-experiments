## Drills
There are five tasks for you to complete. Please give a brief summary of what you did â€“ feel free to include any thoughts / concerns / problems / etc. you encountered during the tasks. Also, include your answers to the questions asked in each task. Save your report as a PDF and submit it to Canvas before the deadline.

### Task: Summary



### Task: Question Answers

> 1. Describe your attack step by step in the report.
> 
> First, I tried just by sending syn packets with one script with a spoofed source of "192.168.150.100" to the victim. The webserver continued to work.

> I then changed the IPv4 settings to stop using syn cookies, to retransmitt packets more, and reduced the TCP queue. I then ran the script again. The victim recorded getting these packets every 20-50 ns. The web server hosted on the victim continued to work. 
>
> Next I tried using three scripts each flooding with syn packets. Using wireshark on the victim recorded closer to 20-30 ns between packets.
>
> I then changed the script to randomize the spoofed IP address for every packet. (Between 192.168.150.0-255) Now, using wireshark on the victim machine reported similar rates of syn packets, however, now the vicitm is trying to acknowledge.
> 
> Changed the script to randomize the entire address. Simliar rates were observed with 3 scripts. However, now wireshark isn't indicating that a port is being reused.

> I just realized that I wasn't attacking the correct port... I was send syn packets to port 80. Now, using a single script, without random source IPs, is enough to deny service.
>
> Now, using netstat -atn on the victim vm, we can see that multiple open tcp connections are waiting for an ACK. Interestingly, connections are still open waiting on random IPs since I ran the script with random IPs at port 8000.

> I restarted the victim to clear the open TCP connections, and ran a single script with no randomization. It didn't work this time. I realized I probably have to change the IPv4 settings again. However, it still didn't work.

> Runing two scripts with random source IPs was able to deny service. Interestingly, after doing this, running a single script with no random IPs was able to deny service. I believe this is because after so many possible connections from every IP address, the victim can't determine if this is a repeated packet very well.

> 2. Include screenshots for each *major* step (e.g., wireshark, half-opened connections, etc.).
